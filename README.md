# VFL — Vee Face Library
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/j0lol/vee/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/j0lol/vee?branch=main)

Research library for replicating Mii functionality from decompilations in a more modern language & runtime. Ideally, this library will replicate functionality accurately from these targets:
- Cafe (WUP)
- Centrair (CTR) <sup><sub>Why did they name it after an airport‽</sub></sup>
- Nx (NX)

Targets not currently aimed for:
- Revolution (RFL)
- Nitro (NTR)


Features are limited, currently.
